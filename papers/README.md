These papers were written in 2003 and 2004 to teach myself the techniques of exploitation of bugs in applications so that arbitrary code could be executed. The purpose was out of interest and for lulz, mainly to take over peoples IRC channels, steal their botnets and have cool psybnc connects while idling. I even got an honorable mention in h0n0 magazine, thats when I knew I made it as a k-rad r4xx0r and could get a job doing what I loved!

These papers were written in 2003 and 2004 to teach myself the techniques required to exploit bugs in applications so that arbitrary code could be executed.

The purpose was out of interest and for fun and not for fame or money, therefor I mainly used those skills to take over peoples hack/phrack IRC channels so as to compromise their botnets, 0days and scripts, as well as having cool psybnc connects while idling.

These papers let me take over #efnet and even get an honorable mention in h0n0 magazine, which is when I knew I made it as a script kid and could ./ for a job.
